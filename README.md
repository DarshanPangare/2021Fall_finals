## Overview: 

Authorities are becoming increasingly concerned about price swings as global warming threatens to undermine the food supply. There has been a variance in the prices of some commodities around the world in recent decades. 

Some of these effects on food are less severe, but many come with the potential for harmful consequences: toxins produced by crops in response, record-breaking high temperatures, delays in the transportation of crops and foods, imbalances in supply and demand, and skyrocketing prices for produce.

There are various reasons why food prices are rising in various part of the world, in the short-term, many factors affect food prices, making them volatile. These factors include supply and demand, weather, disease outbreaks, war, and natural disasters.



Variations in food prices are associated with several factors:

1.     Countryâ€™s development status.

2.     Country Status Dataset: https://github.com/DarshanPangare/2021Fall_finals/blob/main/Dataset/Country_status_price.xlsx

3.     Unpredictable temperature and weather variations

4.     Natural disasters or calamities destroy the harvested produce, resulting in lower supply and higher demand.



## Datasets:

All the data files used in the program can be found on the below link: One would need to download these files to run the code on their local machine.

1.     Global food prices dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices

2.     Country Status Dataset: https://github.com/DarshanPangare/2021Fall_finals/blob/main/Dataset/Country_status_price.xlsx

2.     Food prices dataset for United State: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PP

3.     Storm dataset for various years: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/



## To analyze the scenario described above, we have proposed the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: The hike in the price of bread for developing countries is low as compared to underdeveloped countries.

Hypothesis 2: The occurrence of a natural disaster such as storm has effect over the rise in food prices.
