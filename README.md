## Overview: 

Authorities are becoming increasingly concerned about price swings as global warming threatens to undermine the food supply. There has been a variance in the prices of some commodities around the world in recent decades.

Variations in food prices are associated with several factors:

1.     Countryâ€™s development status.

2.     Unpredictable temperature and weather variations

3.     Natural disasters or calamities destroy the harvested produce, resulting in lower supply and higher demand.



## Datasets:

All the data files used in the program can be found on the below link: One would need to download these files to run the code on their local machine.

1.     Global food prices dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/global-food-prices

2.     Food prices dataset for United State: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PP

3.     Storm dataset for various years: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/



## To analyze the scenario described above, we have proposed the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: The hike in the price of bread for developing countries is low as compared to underdeveloped countries.

Hypothesis 2: The occurrence of a natural disaster such as storm has effect over the rise in food prices.
